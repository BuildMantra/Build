# Introduction üåå
Osense is an innovative project leveraging artificial intelligence with the goal to create an AI agents that mirror different characters and people on social media and build personalitys off them.

This is done through our LLM model that sifts through past historical articales, speeches, and videos and builts an agent model. 

On top of this, Osense also contains this same degree of machine learning for other platforms, such as

Tiktok, Instagram, X ( Formally Twitter ), Youtube

- ‚òÅ **Natural language as code** - Deploy powerful agents using markdown, making automation accessible to all.
- ‚ú® **AI-powered execution** - Take advantage of cutting-edge AI models to bring super-intelligence to your workflows.
- üîå **Flexible and adaptable** - Connect with any AI provider or run models locally, for complete control and flexibility.
- üé´ **Full logical control** - Create complex workflows with loops and conditional branching, just like traditional programming but in plain English.
